# Introduction to XProc 3.0 - DocEng 2019 - Berlin

[XProc 3.0](http://spec.xproc.org/master/head/xproc/) is an XML based programming language for complex document processing. Documents flow through pipelines in which steps perform processing like conversion, validation, split, merge, report, etc. Itâ€™s an almost perfect fit for the kind of processing necessary in document engineering.

The [19th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering](https://doceng.org/doceng2019/index) (September 23-26, Berlin) will kick off with a day of tutorials and workshops. One of these will be an introduction to XProc 3.0.

The [DocEng-2019-XProc GitHub repository](https://github.com/eriksiegel/DocEng-2019-XProc) will be used to host all materials (presentations, exercises, etc.) for this tutorial. It will be filled in the weeks leading up to the conference.
